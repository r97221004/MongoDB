    "\n",

    "For those of you who are familiar with software architecture design, you probably know the Design Patterns book from the Gang of Four.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is doing for software design what our patterns will do for data modeling and schema design for document databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns we'll go over in this chapter will become a cookbook of powerful transformation to unleash the power of MongoDB schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how to optimize when faced with large documents with a subset pattern, use the computed pattern to avoid repeated computations, structure similar fields with the attribute pattern, handle changes to your deployment without downtime with the schema versioning pattern, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those patterns will also serve as a common language for your teams working on schema designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, having well-defined patterns and understanding when and how to use them will remove a little bit of the are in data modeling for MongoDB and make the process more predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will have a lesson to introduce each pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will follow with a lab to have you put in practice the pattern you just learned about.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot to cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it will be fun, and you should profit a lot.\n",

    "Let's organize what we've been describing and illustrating a little bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem to the subset pattern addresses is that too many frequently use pieces of information-- or I checked it from memory, which can be identified by observing a working set that this too big to fit in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digging into the majority of documents in memory, we can observe that we only make use of a small subset of information in those documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "So a large part of those documents is rarely needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution is to break apart the documents that are taking too much space in RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will divide the fields of information into two camps-- the field that are often required by our system, and the ones that are rarely required.\n",
    "\n",
    "This division is frequently used for one-to-many or many-to-many relationship, for which you only want to keep a subset of the many associated document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In which type of applications or situation are we likely to apply this pattern?\n",
    "\n",
    "A list of reviews for a product, a movie, or news articles-- well, anything that can be discussed or reviewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "List of anything that can be long and carries much more data than anyone can or wants to process or read.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this list takes a substantial amount of memory, they are good candidates to be offload to another collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of applying the subset pattern, our working set will not only be smaller, but it will make retrieving additional documents faster since they will be smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there are some trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you have more documents to retrieve, which means that you may have to make more round trips between the application and the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "And second, the fact that you break documents in two and duplicate some info means that the database will require a little bit more space on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not a big issue as this space is much cheaper than RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how the subset pattern works.\n",
    "\n",
