    "Hi.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm Daniel, one of your instructors for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you ever wonder what is the single most important aspect of using MongoDB to ensure good performance, maximize the productivity of your developers, and minimize the overall cost of your solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes-- a good data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to M320, the data modeling course for MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we're going to discuss all aspects of data modeling for MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to gather the requirements to create the data model, learn those requirements into a basic model, apply powerful transformation patterns to optimize your data model, and finally, understand how to evolve your data model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with that knowledge, you'll be able to design schema to make the best use of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is five chapters long.\n",
    "\n",
    "With each chapter, there is a set of lesson videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "After most of these lessons, there is a quiz and labs to assess your learning of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go over a few logistics for the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the target audience?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's an advanced course.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is geared more toward architects and developers, then DevOp people.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, everyone can benefit from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're used to tabular or relational databases, we try to make the parallel between MongoDB and these databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course has another course as a prerequisite, M001, Introduction to MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not done this course, you should be familiar with the following-- using a cluster deploy in Atlas, using Compass to access the cluster, and you should also be familiar with database concepts and vocabulary, reading an entity relationship diagram using the Crow's Foot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not, we recommend you take our beginners course, M001, and go through the additional external resources we reference in the first lesson of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does grading work?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quizzes, labs, and a final exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quizzes are ungraded and exist to make sure that you understand the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade in the class will be based on how well you do on the labs and the final exam, each of these being worth 50% of your grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "To receive a certificate of course completion, you need a passing grade of 65% or higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will highly encourage you to participate in the discussion forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have knowledgeable MongoDB employees who are there to help answer your questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have your classmates, who can also contribute to answering your question and are often beneficial and very knowledgeable resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've observed that students who perform best in the courses are those who are the most active in the discussion forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this course, you should be ready to design schema for your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that said, we're excited to have you as a student in this class."

    "When dealing with database schema and data modeling, we sometimes find ourselves doing things because we saw something on the internet or got some friendly advice on how to do things, which might not be the most correct way and based on some misconceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common misconceptions about data modeling in MongoDB is that modeling is schemaless, meaning that it doesn't really matter which field documents have or how different the documents can be from one another, or even how many collections you might have per database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although that can be a flattering way of positioning in the flexibility of MongoDB, this is not practical in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "What MongoDB unquestionably has is a very flexible data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no default rules on what documents should be looking like apart from having correctly been defined in BSON and containing a primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "But most importantly, all data as some sort of structure and therefore, a schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB he just happens to make it easier for you to deal with that later rather than sooner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you jump into an ERD or UML tooling, in order to determine the full scope of your data structures, it tends to be preferable to start building your application and finding out from that particular experience what the data structure should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you do know your usage pattern how your data is accessed, which queries are critical to your application, and ratios between reads and writes, you will be able to extract a very good model, even before rewriting the full application to make it scale with MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being flexible means that your application changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it's not unreasonable to think that that will not be the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to accommodate those changes without experiencing a painful migration process, like in traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start having a pretty good idea of how documents should be looking like and should be shaped out and which data types those fields you have, you'll be able to enforce those rules in MongoDB by using document validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another misconception is that all information, regardless of how data should be manipulated, can be stored in one single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some use cases where this approach is actually correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the reality is that this is not the way applications in general use data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about your user profile, where we have a profile data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that gives us the current state of the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when thinking about all the different changes that that given user might incur over a period of time, like for example, all the variations in musical tastes, profile messages, new friendships, new likes, new reviews, new romantic partnerships, you might get a good understanding that that profile will grow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you tried to store all that information, 99% of the time all you do is get the latest version of that profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might not be helping your application all that much by storing all these sorts of information of that user in one big document.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a user interacts more with your application, more data will be accumulated, and your performance will be dropping considerably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the amount of information stored per individual documents to the data that your application uses and having different models to deal with historical data or other types of data that are not always accessed is something that we'll be looking into in this course, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "And there is also this perception that there is no way to perform a join between documents in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "While MongoDB does not call dollar look up a join, for many good reasons, you can still perform all sorts of joins in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it can certainly do these types of relational operations in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be showing you models where you can make the most out of them on top of Mongo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, finding a schema design that suits your application or application needs is not an easy job to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data, at times, may be very, very unstructured or with quite a high degree of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will teach you how to look harder with the tools and procedures to identify such a schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, MongoDB will most definitely shine on these three main aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run MongoDB anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use MongoDB for any type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you can put your data everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be looking into ways of showing how to design for scalability, flexibility, and performance, showing how MongoDB allows you to deal with change, scale, and make your applications more dynamic and flexible."

    "In this lesson, we're going to cover the MongoDB document model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in MongoDB stored in a hierarchical structure where the database are at the top level where each MongoDB deployment can have many databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are one or more collections in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, there are documents which are kept at the collection level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MongoDB, data is stored as BSON documents that are composed of field value pairs, where BSON is a binary representation of JSON documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since BSON is not human-readable, we will stick with JSON in our examples throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does a document like that look?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping with the standard JSON notation, we have an open curly bracket indicating the beginning of a document, followed by several field value pairs separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each value can be of any BSON data type, which in this case are a string, an integer, another string, and an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MongoDB, a document is a collection of attributes for an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're coming from SQL, a document is like a row in the table that has been joined with other relevant rows from other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a field and its assigned value, just like each column in a row has a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we're looking at a variety of field types which are all supported by MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a string, an integer, an array, a document, and an array of documents, which make up a single document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful feature of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of having to query multiple tables of related data and assembling it all together, you can keep your related data in a single document and pull it all down using a single query.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with computer programming languages, then you could consider a MongoDB document as being similar to a dictionary or a map or an associative array-- an object that has a number of key value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since MongoDB documents support a flexible structure, you can use a document to represent an entire object rather than having to break up the data across multiple records as you would have to do with the relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact structure of a document-- all the fields, values, and embedded documents-- represent the schema of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably heard the term flexible schema thrown around in relation to MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, let's just clarify this term.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB documents have a flexible schema in that you're not required to make complicated changes to a collection's metadata to add or remove the fields in a documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents in the same collection don't need to have the exact same list of fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the data type in any given field can vary across documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to make changes at the cluster level to support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to view this is that you can have multiple versions of your schema as your application develops over time and all the schema versions can coexist in the same collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this to database solutions where adding of removing columns or fields or changing the data type of that column or field can be a complicated process.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, chances are that the documents in a given collection will have a common structure between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB supports enforcing the schema shape from no rules, rules in a few fields, to rules on all the fields of the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB stores data as documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document fields can be values, embedded documents, or arrays of values and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a flexible schema database."

    "And it's available as quickly as needed by our lungs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you were an astronaut like my friend David, here, your life will depend on the careful planning of the supply, the estimation of its usage, and securing the oxygen from any danger or accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "My point being that if the resource is abundant and can be transferred without delay, there is not much planning or modeling to do about the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, with computers, we deal with limited resources, which are crippled by restrictions of size, speed, and cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, you need to model to make the best of the resources available and work around the restrictions that you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAM is the fastest location where you can put data, besides the processor caches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it becomes very expensive if you need a humongous amount of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, you are likely to offload some of the data to disk, which are cheaper and have larger capacities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solid State Drives, or SSDs, would be the preferred type of disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the cost of high-capacity SSDs may be more than you're ready to spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this situation, you may consider traditional hard disk drives.\n",

    "\n",
    "So the first phase is to look at the documents that you have in your input and create some artifacts out of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to size the amount of data your system will have initially, in few months, and in few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, you will get those number wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practice makes perfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "So give it your best try.\n",
    "\n",
    "The action of recording those numbers will permit you to observe any major deviations in your system once it's in operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those differences will be a good indicator that you may have to iterate again over your schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies to the operations, the reads and the writes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to tell how many are run per unit of time and if each query has additional requirements in terms of execution time, the latency from the application, tolerance to staleness, et cetera.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these operation requirements, record your thoughts and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "They will also be a good indicator to see whether you need to reevaluate the model again later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our second phase, we start with a piece of information that were identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each piece has a relationship with another one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ones that have a one-to-one relationship tend to be grouped together in the same table or collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modeling for a relational database, you would probably have come up with those three entities-- actors, movies, and reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "And place the piece of information inside the appropriate entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a movie title has a one-to-many relationship to the reviews for the movie, while the money earned by the movie has a one-to-one relationship with the movie title.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the movie title and its revenues are in the same entity or collection, while the reviews are in a separate collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "With MongoDB, you follow the same process of identifying the relationships between the pieces of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you need to decide if you embed information or keep it separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you decide?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you start using the knowledge you will acquire in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this process, you will have a list of entities with their fields, some of them grouped together inside the common collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our last phase is to apply schema design patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you will get to make your model more performant or more clear by applying some transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover this phase of the methodology in a future chapter by giving you a number of recipes you can apply to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to iteratively improve your solution, and this is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of the input information on the left changes, you need to assess the impact on the decision you've made in their corresponding phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you discover another reported query, get more data about the size of your problem, or run benchmarks on your current solution, all that known information, with feedback as the input to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any successful application will undergo modifications at some point in its lifetime, so be ready to get new inputs at some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you track why you made some decision and what were the assumptions in the past, it will be much easier to apply the needed changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap what we have learned in this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three phases in our methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first addresses the workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to identify the size of your data, the important reads and writes of the system, and possibly quantify and qualify those operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second phase regards the identification of the relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming out of that step, you should have a list of collection with the decision of whether you embed or link the relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third step is to apply schema design patterns to your model to address the performance requirements by applying the needed optimizations."

    "In this lesson, we will dig into how much you should model-- in other words, how many steps should be done in the three phases of our methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main trade that you will face is simplicity versus performance, prioritizing one over the other or trying to find a balance between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modeling for simplicity means we will avoid any complexity that could slow down the development of the system by our engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most typical case would be developing an application quickly with one or few software engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently, for those kind of projects, there are limited expectations and small requirements in term of CPU, disk, I/O, memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things are generally small and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should start by identifying the most important operations for the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "And you will need to establish the relationships between the entities and fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the model simple, you are likely to group a lot of those pieces inside a few collection using sub-documents or arrays to represent the one-to-one, one-to-many, too many-to-many many relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "By keeping the modeling steps to the minimum, we can remain very agile, with the ability to quickly iterate on our application, reflecting these changes back into the model if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you model for simplicity, as a result, you will likely see fewer collection in your design where each document contains more information and maps very well to the object you have in your application code-- the objects being represented in your favorite language as hashes, maps, dictionary, or nested objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, as a result of having larger documents with embedded documents in them, the application is likely to do less disk accesses to retrieve the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three collection embedded into one, a single read will be sufficient to retrieve the information instead of four.\n",
    "\n",
    "At other end of our axis, we have the performance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, resources are likely to be used to the maximum I like to compare this situation to an engine running at the red line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Project that makes use of sharding to scatter horizontally are likely to fall into this category, because you often shard your database because there is not enough resources available with a simple replica set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system may require very fast read or writes operation, or it may have to support a ton of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although situations are demanding a model for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex projects are often done by larger teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "And those larger teams will require a little bit more modeling upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you model for performance or have more complexity to handle, you want to go over all the steps of the methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, you start by identifying the important operations, but also quantify(量化) those in terms of metrics like operation per second, required latency, and pinning some quality attributes on those queries such as-- can the application work with data that's a little stale, are those operations parts of the large analytic query?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you model for performance you will often see more collection in your design.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to apply a series of schema design patterns to ensure the best usage of resources like CPU, disk, bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "And in between, well, you have project that have more of a balance or trade between those two criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may have a project that needs to be developed quickly, but you will also need to apply some transformations and optimization to meet performance requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will need to identify what seems important for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positioning your project on this axis is a little bit of an art.\n",
    "\n",
    "My advice is it is easier to find optimization later on than to remove complexity from an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "So prior to rise simplicity over performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look again at the steps you may do for each phase based on your requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of your project, you will need to start by identifying your workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can go from a simple identification of the most important operations to an exhaustive and complete description of the read and write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you need to choose between embedding or linking the model, the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity will favor embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final phase, the more performance requirements you have, the more likely patterns will be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recap what we've learned this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB makes the development of applications much faster than traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we don't want the methodology to slow things down either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing the right thing first and having a way to share information between the team members is important for having a successful project.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, recognize the trade off between modeling for simplicity and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, use the methodology in a flexible fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Select the step within a phase that makes sense for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, regardless of how much you will model, you need to start by describing the workload of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying the important operations correctly will get you started on the right path."
