    "In this lesson, we're going to discuss user defined roles in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by talking about why user defined roles are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "How they compare to the built-in roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "And how to create these user defined roles in the mongo's show.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, why would we create a user defined role?\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB provides 15 built-in roles for administrators to use for role based access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is MongoDB's native authorization mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "But these roles are provided for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "They may not describe the required set of privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't mean user administrators should never use the built-in roles, you should just know that they might not address every database requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the built-in roles fall short of expectations, user admins can always create new roles that have more fine grained access.\n",
    "\n",
    "User admins may want to do this because the built-in roles grant too many privileges and they want to create a role that grants fewer privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows user administrators to adhere to the principle of least privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a new vocabulary term so let's define it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of least privilege says that users should have the least privilege required for their intended purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one branch of a popular bank probably holds over 50 bank employees and every employee requires the privilege to enter the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "But not every employee at the bank should be able to enter the bank vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, this privilege is only granted to the one person whose job actually requires them to enter the bank vault.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the built-in role user admin."
