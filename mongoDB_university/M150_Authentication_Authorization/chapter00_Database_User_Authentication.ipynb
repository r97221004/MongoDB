    "In this lesson, we're going to define authentication and authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between these two things and how they are represented in MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first let's define these two terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication verifies the identity of a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Authorization determines the verified users access to resources and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's say you're checking your bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your account balances live in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before you can read the balances the database needs to verify your identity as the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the server prompts the user to prove itself by asking the user, please enter your email address and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user then presents their username ilovecats@email.com and their password cats are my fav 1986.\n",
    "\n",
    "If at some point in the future this user decides that they want to change their username or change their password.\n",
    "\n",
    "That would be an example of updating this user's authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "So after inputting the password in the username, the server will then verify this user's identity based on whether that user exists with those credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the database does not recognize the credentials, it will send a message to the user saying that the authentication has failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the database does recognize the user's credentials then it automatically moves on to authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once MongoDB verifies the identity of a user at that needs to determine this user's authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back to our example, the database has verified the credentials for the user ilovecats@email.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the database has to determine what level of access this user has.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions that a given user is allowed to perform are referred to as privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a bank account or an ATM this user has access to their account balances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, they are not authorized to read the balances of other users bank accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This user is also authorized to withdraw money from their account but there's a limit to how much money can be withdrawn each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you can contact your bank to raise this limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raising the withdrawal limit is an example of changing authorization without affecting the way that this user authenticates to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now let's see how authorization and authentication are represented in MongoDB."

    "Now the portion of the user document that is highlighted right now pertains to authorization.\n",

    "Below the credentials is an array field called roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roles are one of the primary ways of granting privileges to a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each role is an alias for a collection of privileges.\n",

    "\n",
    "But admins also have the ability to create their own custom roles with any privileges that they choose.\n",

    "So the first role was the readRole on the accounts database.\n",

    "Having the role and no other privileges on the accounts database means that the account analytics user can read data from the accounts database but it can't write any new data.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This means that our user can read data and the analytics database as well as writing new data to that database.\n",

    "MongoDB's access control system allows us to issue permissions to users in this granular way.\n",
